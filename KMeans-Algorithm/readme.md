# K-means algorithm

K-means clustering is a popular algorithm used for customer segmentation. It is an unsupervised machine learning technique that aims to divide a dataset into a specified number of clusters based on the similarity of data points.

## Here's how k-means clustering can be applied to customer segmentation:

1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Feature selection
4. Determine the number of clusters (k)
5. Apply k-means clustering
6. Interpret and evaluate the clusters
7. Implement targeted marketing strategies
8. Monitor and refine

# Libraries used
